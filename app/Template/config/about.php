    <p> Prime Project Master uses Kanboard concept to easily visualize flow of activities.
    It can be used for effectively controlling any process be it Projects, Education, Schools, Sales, Society Maintenance Management 
    and even govt. process. Though current template is developed keeping projects in mind.
    Its is developed based on open source and encourage anyone to reach out to me to collaborate and build further on it.
    It can be adapted by SME for their project management either in-house or cloud based. Please visit us @ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ProjectPrimeOffice/" target="_blank"> <i class="fa fa-handshake-o fa-fw"></i>ProjectPrimeOffie</a> for your feedback and comments.
