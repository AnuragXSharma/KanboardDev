Time Tracking
=============

Time tracking information can be defined at the task level or at the subtask level.

Task time tracking
------------------

Tasks have two fields:

- Time estimated
- Time spent

These values represent hours of work and have to be set manually.

Subtask time tracking
---------------------

![Subtask time tracking](../screenshots/subtask-time-tracking.png)

Subtasks also have the fields "time spent" and "time estimated".

When you change the value of these fields, **the task time tracking values are updated automatically and becomes the sum of all subtask values**.

Kanboard records the time between each subtask status change in a separate table.

- Changing subtask status from **todo** to **in pogress** logs the start time
- Changing subtask status from **in progress** to **done** logs the end time but also update the time spent of the subtask and the task

The breakdown of all records is visible in the task view page:

For each subtask, the timer can be stopped/started at any time:

- The timer doesn't depend of the subtask status
- Each time you start the timer a new record is created in the time tracking table
- Each time you stop the clock the end date is recorded in the time tracking table
- The calculated time spent is rounded to the nearest quarter (only for Kanboard < 1.0.32)
