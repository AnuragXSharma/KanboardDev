- The **start date** and the **due date** of tasks are used to draw the chart
- Tasks can be resized and moved horizontally with your mouse
- There is no vertical drag and drop
- The bar is the same color as the task
- Each bar display a progression status in percentage, this percentage is calculated by using the column position on the board
- To fit with the Kanban model, tasks can be ordered by the board positions or by the start date
- New tasks created from this view will be displayed on the board at the position 1 in the first column
- Tasks are displayed in black when there is no start or due date defined
