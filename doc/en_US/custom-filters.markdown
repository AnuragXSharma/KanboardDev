Custom Filters
==============

Custom filters allow you to save any search query.
In this way, you can extend the default filters easily and save most used search queries.

- Custom filters are stored by project and associated to the creator.
- If the creator is project manager, he can choose to share the filter with other project members.

Filter creation
---------------

Go to the action drop-down or in the project settings and choose **custom filters**:
