Project Types
=============

There are two kinds of projects:

| Type              | Description                                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Team Project      | Project with user and group management                                |
| Private Project   | Project that belongs to only one person, there is no user management  |

- Only Administrators and Application Managers can create team projects.
- Private projects can be created by anyone.
