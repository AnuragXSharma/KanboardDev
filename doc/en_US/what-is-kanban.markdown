What is Kanban?
===============

Kanban is a methodology originally developed by Toyota to be more efficient.

There are only two constraints imposed by Kanban:

- Visualize your workflow
- Limit your work in progress

Visualize your workflow
-----------------------

- Your work is displayed on a board so that you have a clear overview of your project
- Each column represents a step in your workflow

Limit your work in progress
----------------------------------
- Encourages focus by avoiding multitasking
- Each phase can have work-in-progress limits
- Limits help identify bottlenecks
- Limits avoid working on too many tasks at the same time

Performance Measurement
=======================

Kanban uses lead and cycle times to measure performance:

- **Lead time**: Time between task creation and completion
- **Cycle time**: Time between task start and completion

For example, you may have a lead time of 100 days but only have to work 1 hour to complete the task.
