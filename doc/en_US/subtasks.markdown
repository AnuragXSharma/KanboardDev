Subtasks
========

Subtasks are useful to split the work of a task.

Each subtask:

- Can be assigned to a project member
- Have 3 different statuses: **Todo**, **In progress**, **Done**
- Have time tracking information: **time spent** and **time estimated**
- Be ordered by position

Creating subtasks
-----------------

From the task view, on left sidebar click on **Add a subtask**:

![Add a subtask](../screenshots/add-subtask.png)

You can also add a subtask quickly by entering only the title:

Change subtask status
---------------------

When you click on the subtask title the status change:

![Subtask in progress](../screenshots/subtask-status-inprogress.png)

The icon before the title is updated according to the status.

![Subtask done](../screenshots/subtask-status-done.png)

Note: When the task is closed, all subtasks are changed to the status **Done**.

Subtask timer
-------------

- Each time a subtask is in progress, the timer is also started. The timer can be started and stopped at any time.
- The timer records the time spent on the subtask automatically. You can also change manually the value of the time spent field when you edit a subtask.
- The time calculated is rounded to the nearest quarter. This information is recorded in a separate table.
- The task time spent and time estimated is updated automatically according to the sum of all subtasks.
