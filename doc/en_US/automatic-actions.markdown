Automatic Actions
=================

To minimize user interaction, Kanboard support automated actions.

Each automatic action is defined with these properties:

- An event to listen
- Action linked to the event
- Additional parameters

Each project has a different set of automatic actions. The configuration panel is located on the project listing page - just click on the link **Automatic actions**.

Add a new action

Examples

Here are some examples used in real life:

### When I move a task to the column "Done", automatically close this task

- Choose action: **Close a task in a specific column**
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**
- Define action parameter: **Column = Done** (this is the destination column)

### When I move a task to the column "To be validated", assign this task to a specific user

- Choose the action: **Assign the task to a specific user**
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**
- Define the action parameters: **Column = To be validated** and **User = Bob** (Bob is our tester)

### When I move a task to the column "Work in progress", assign this task to the current user

- Choose action: **Assign the task to the person who does the action when the column is changed**
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**
- Define action parameter: **Column = Work in progress**

### When a task is completed, duplicate this task to another project

Let's say we have two projects: "Customer orders" and "Production". Once the order is validated, swap it to the "Production" project.

- Choose action: **Duplicate the task to another project**
- Choose the event: **Closing a task**
- Define action parameters: **Column = Validated** and **Project = Production**

### When a task is moved to the last column, move the exact same task to another project

Let's say we have two projects: "Ideas" and "Development".  Once the idea is validated, swap it to the "Development" project.

- Choose action: **Move the task to another project**
- Choose the event: **Move a task to another column**
- Define action parameters: **Column = Validated** and **Project = Development**

### I want to assign automatically a color to the user Bob

- Choose action: **Assign a color to a specific user**
- Choose the event: **Task assignee change**
- Define action parameters: **Color = Green** and **Assignee = Bob**

### I want to assign a color automatically to the defined category "Feature Request"

- Choose action: **Assign automatically a color based on a category**
- Choose the event: **Task creation or modification**
- Define action parameters: **Color = Blue** and **Category = Feature Request**

### I want to set the start date automatically when the task is moved to the column "Work in progress"

- Choose action: **Automatically update the start date**
