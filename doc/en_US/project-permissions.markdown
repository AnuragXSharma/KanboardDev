Project Permissions
===================

Each project is isolated from other projects.
Project access must be allowed by the project owner.

Each user and each group can have a different role assigned.
There are 3 types of [roles for projects](roles.markdown):

- Project Manager
- Project Member
- Project Viewer

Only administrators have access to everything.

Role assignments are visible in **Project Settings > Permissions**:

Private projects cannot define permissions.
