Internal Task Links
===================

Tasks can be linked together with pre-defined relationships:

This is also possible to link tasks across projects.

The default relationships are:

- **relates to**
- **blocks** | is blocked by
- **is blocked by** | blocks
- **duplicates** | is duplicated by
- **is duplicated by** | duplicates
- **is a child of** | is a parent of
- **is a parent of** | is a child of
- **targets milestone** | is a milestone of
- **is a milestone of** | targets milestone
- **fixes** | is fixed by
- **is fixed by** | fixes

Those labels can be changed in the application settings.
