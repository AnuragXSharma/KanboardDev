Adding screenshots
==================

You can copy and paste images directly in Kanboard to save time.
These images are uploaded as attachments to the task.

This is especially useful for taking screenshots to describe an issue for example.

You can add screenshots directly from the board by clicking on the dropdown menu or in the task view page.

To add a new image, take your screenshot and paste with CTRL+V or Command+V:

On Mac OS X, you can use those shortcuts to take screenshots:

- Command-Control-Shift-3: Take a screenshot of the screen, and save it to the clipboard
- Command-Control-Shift-4, then select an area: Take a screenshot of the area and save it to the clipboard
- Command-Control-Shift-4, then space, then click a window: Take a screenshot of a window and save it to the clipboard

There are also several third-party applications that can be used to take screenshots with annotations and shapes.

**Note: This feature doesn't work with all browsers.** It doesn't work with Safari due to this bug: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49141
