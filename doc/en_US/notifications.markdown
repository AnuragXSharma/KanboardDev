Notifications
=============

Kanboard is able to send notifications through several channels:

- Email
- Web (List of unread messages)

External plugins allow you to send notifications to Slack, Hipchat, Jabber or any chat system.

Configuration
-------------

Each user must enable the notifications in their profile: **User Profile > Notifications**. It's disabled by default.

To receive email notifications you need a valid email address in your profile and the application must be configured to send emails.

You can choose your favorite notification method:

- Emails
- Web (see below)

For each project you are a member, you can choose to receive notifications for:

- All tasks
- Only for tasks assigned to you
- Only for tasks created by you
- Only for tasks created by you and assigned to you

You can also select only some projects, by default it's all projects where you are a member.

Web notifications
-----------------

Web notifications are available from the dashboard or from the icon at the top:

Notifications are shown in a list, so you can mark individual notification as read or everything.

In this way you can still get notified without having to receive emails.
