Board, Calendar and List Views
==============================

For each project, tasks can be visualized with several views: **Board, Calendar, List and Gantt**.
Each view shows the result of the filter box at the top.
The search engine uses the [advanced syntax](search.markdown).

Board View
----------

![Board view](../screenshots/board-view.png)

- With this view, you can drag and drop tasks between columns easily.
- You can also use the keyboard shortcut **"v b"** to switch to the board view.
- Tasks with a shadow are recently modified.

![Board Task Limit](../screenshots/board-task-limit.png)

When the task limit is reached for a column, the background becomes red. That means there are too many tasks in progress at the same time.
